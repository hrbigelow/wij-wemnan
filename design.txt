three buffers

1. visible buffer.

This is the plot the user sees.  The vertices are plotted with the
given color, shape and size.  The positions are affine-transformed
according to the user's choices.

3. selection buffer.

The buffer that holds the area the user has selected.  One question is
whether to allow this to represent the entire set of areas selected by
the user, or just the most recent contiguous area.

2. hitlist buffer.

This is the buffer that represents the entire set of vertices in a
single line, one pixel per vertex.  The positions of the pixels match
the indices in the vertex array. The color signifies whether the
vertex is 'selected' or not, based on a texture sampling of the
selection buffer.


Since the set of already-selected vertices will be established at the
completion of the previous user selected process, we need not worry
about supporting a non-contiguous selection area in the selection
buffer.  Instead, the selection buffer can simply represent one
contiguous mouse-down / mouse-up event.  Either this will be a
free-form area, or a rectangle.

A problem arises.  The maximum texture size for a given platform is
most likely smaller than the view port that is visible to the user.
And, the selection procedure is much easier to write if it can rely on
just a single selection texture.  So, the solution should be the following:

1.  Maintain a viewport-sized buffer holding the current selection
area.  (This may in fact also be visible to the user, composited with
the main buffer)

2.  Maintain a textureViewportOffset coordinate, the position of the
texture origin within the viewport origin (both are upper-left-hand
corners).  The position is given in pixels.  The initial value of
textureOffset should be set to be:

texOrigin = min(viewSize - texSize, max(zero, drawStart, texSize/2))

in other words, set it so that the position where the user starts
drawing the selection area lies in the center of the viewport, bounded
of course by the limits of the viewport.  the variables are:

texOrigin: position in viewport of the texture Origin corner
viewSize: the vector describing the size of the viewport
texSize: vector describing size of the texture
zero: the zero vector

drawStart: start position in the viewport where the user starts to
  draw the selection area.
